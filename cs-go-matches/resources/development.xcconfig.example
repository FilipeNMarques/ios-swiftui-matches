/// To run the project successfully, you need to configure the API key for PandaScore.
/// Follow these steps to set up your development environment:
///
/// 1. Copy the configuration file:
///    - Duplicate `development.xcconfig.example` and rename it to `development.xcconfig`
/// 2. Set up your API key:
///    - Open `development.xcconfig`
///    - Locate the `API_KEY` field
///    - Replace the placeholder with your PandaScore API key
/// 3. Verify Xcode configuration:
///    - Ensure your Xcode project is set to use `development.xcconfig` in build settings
///
/// - **Important:** Never commit `development.xcconfig` to version control to protect your API key.
